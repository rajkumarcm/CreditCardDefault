# Credit Card Default Analysis and Prediction  

## Introduction  

This repository contains implementation of "Credit Card Default Analysis and Prediction" using R Programming language. 

I am sure you have often come across headlines such as financial crisis caused by Credit Card Debt, and I thought this topic would be ideal for the Data Science project.  

Some of the core objectives of this project would be to:  
1. Find the demographic pattern in those who default  
2. Find the repayment pattern found in those who default  
3. Fit a statistical model to find rules to predict applicant who may default
